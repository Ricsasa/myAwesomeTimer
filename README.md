# My awesome timer

## Ricardo SÃ¡nchez Saldivar

This timer works using vanilla javascript. The first time is executed, it shows you the time until the next day, but using the controllers you can specify a future date for the timer to show.

It makes use of the flatpickr library (https://github.com/flatpickr/flatpickr) to enable the calendar.
